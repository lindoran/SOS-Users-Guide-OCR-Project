# SOS-Users-Guide-OCR-Project


This is the pdf build automation script for Python3 to format and build PDF 
of the SOS - Small Operating System - Users guide for the Color Computer.

This was found on an EBAY listing in 2024, and purchased for the purpose of 
presurvation.

The manuals are found here without the disks and they were not part of the ebay 
listing.

The disks are missing and would need to be located.

This script is Novel to this project (though modifiying it is not difficult.)
